# Train-Scheduler
In this assignment, I will attempt to create a train schedule application that incorporates Firebase to host arrival and departure data, apparently. The app will retrieve and manipulate this information with Moment.js. This website will provide up-to-date information about various trains, namely their arrival times and how many minutes remain until they arrive at their station, I'm told. Fancy that!
